# Django Blockfolio Clone

Project designed to help me learn Django. The idea of the application is that you will be able to enter in a crypto address or coinbase account and the application will go and check the amount of crypto you have in those accounts and the price of the crypto on the day you recieved or bought it. This will give us the price paid at time of purchase. We will then use the amount of crypto multipled by todays price to give us the value of the crypto today. Using these two values we can tell you how much to have lost and made in absolute and percentage terms.
